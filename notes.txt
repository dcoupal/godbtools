  source /usr/local/go/src/pkg/runtime/runtime-gdb.py

TODOs:
  - diff schemas
  - read schema definition from DB
  - allow to send output to file, testing should be able to match lines in it after.
  - chmod +x on ./runtests
  - scripts to import test data
  - way to disable features/tests for non-active databases
